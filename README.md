# F-Autoclicker
WERE BACK!

Softsquirrel Studios has returned with knowledge of Rust, and now we can create cool stuff like auto clickers that will give us an unfair advantage.

F-Autoclicker is an auto clicker with one goal: To make it harder for it to detect. This was tested on a few Minecraft servers (Hypixel excluded) and you should be fine for most of the time.  \
While testing, we only got banned (likely manually) 1 out of 4 servers tested.

## Features
- Random intervals (so it's harder for anti-cheats to detect)
- Steady increasing/decreasing CPS so you wont go from 0 to 150 CPS in less than a second.
- Ctrl + Q to emergency quit (In case things get out of hand)
- Left *and* Right auto click

# Update 1.1
